The attached files are designed to be added to the generated code of STM32CUBEMX

-> The whole folder "Freertos_plus" is to be copied in the ../Middlewares/Third_Party/
-> The main.c file contains some variables and functions needed to be declared by the 
	program writer to be used by the Freertos ip stack.
	=> So you can copy the whole content or just add the functions and the variables 
	needed on the main.c generated by STM32CUBMX
-> The file FreeRTOSIPConfig.h is a very important file to configure, enable and disable 
	the freertos ip stack features. So you need to add it on path : ../Core/Inc/ 
-> The standard FreeRTOSConfig.h, which will be already generated by STM32CUBEMX, you can 
	copy it or just add the following macro on it :

	#define configUSE_COUNTING_SEMAPHORES            1
